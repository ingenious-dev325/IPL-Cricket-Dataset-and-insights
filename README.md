# ETL Operations README

Performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations on the provided datasets is a crucial step in deriving meaningful insights and facilitating data-driven decision-making processes. This document outlines the process involved in ETL operations, including data ingestion, curation, generation of dimension (dim) and fact tables, insights derived, and the underlying problem statement.

## ETL Process Overview:

### Ingestion:
1. **Extract**: Retrieve datasets from their respective sources (e.g., CSV files).
2. **Transform**: Cleanse data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
3. **Load**: Store transformed data into a data warehouse or database.

### Curation:
1. **Level 1 (L1)**:
   - Basic data cleaning and filtering.
   - Handling missing or inconsistent values.
   - Normalizing data types and formats across datasets.

2. **Level 2 (L2)**:
   - Advanced data cleaning and validation.
   - Standardizing attribute names and values.
   - Handling data anomalies and outliers.

3. **Level 3 (L3)**:
   - Integrating data across multiple datasets.
   - Resolving data conflicts and redundancies.
   - Establishing relationships between datasets.

4. **Level 4 (L4)**:
   - Creating aggregated or derived attributes for analysis.
   - Implementing data quality checks and validation rules.
   - Optimizing data structures for efficient querying.

### Generating Dim and Fact Tables:
- **Dimension Tables**:
  - Team, Player, Ground, Date, Bowler, Batter.

- **Fact Tables**:
  - Match_Details_Fact, Batting_Score_Fact, Bowling_Performance_Fact.

### Insights:
- Player performance analysis.
- Team performance evaluation.
- Ground-wise analysis.
- Toss impact on match outcomes.
- Comparison of powerplay scores and their correlation with match results.

### Problem Statement:
**Why analytics on this dataset?**
- Gaining insights into player and team performance for strategic decision-making.
- Identifying key trends and patterns influencing match outcomes.
- Optimizing player selection, match strategies, and resource allocation.
- Enhancing fan engagement and viewer experience through data-driven storytelling and visualization.
- Supporting sports management, sponsorship decisions, and revenue generation opportunities.

## Getting Started:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure necessary dependencies are installed.
- Run ETL scripts to perform data operations.
- Explore generated dim and fact tables.
- Analyze insights derived from the processed data.
